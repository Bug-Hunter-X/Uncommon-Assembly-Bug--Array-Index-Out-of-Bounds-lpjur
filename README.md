This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in assembly code: accessing an array outside of its allocated bounds. The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides the corrected version with proper index validation.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in low-level programming and the necessity for robust error handling. The bug is caused by the lack of bounds checking for the array index, leading to potential crashes or security vulnerabilities.
